# GMATA
Glad to set up the bioinformatics software GMATA in GitHub
software GMATA
This is the software GMATA at GitHUB
What is software GMATA , The latest version is v2.2 and the previous version was v2.1. 
Genome-wide Microsatellite Analyzing Toward Application (GMATA) is a software for Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) analyses, and SSR marker designing and mapping in any DNA sequences. It has the following functions:
1. SSR mining;
2. Statistical analysis and plotting;
3. SSR loci graphic viewing;
4. Marker designing;
5. Electronic mapping and marker transferability investigation.
GMATA is accurate, sensitive and fast. It was designed to process large genomic sequence data sets, especially large whole genome sequences. In theory, genomes of any size can be analyzed by GMATA easily. Software GMATA works on sever, desktop or even laptop, and it can run in graphic interface with just clicks or run in command line or in automated pipeline. It is also cross-platform and supports Unix/Linux, Win and Mac. Results from software GMATA can be directly graphically displayed with genome or gene features in Gbrowser and easily integrated with any genomic database.

Features
Accurate and fastest SSR mining in any large sequences
Complete statistical analysis and plotting
SSR loci and marker graphic displaying in Gbrowser with genome features
Specific SSR marker designing, and simulated PCR
Electronic mapping, and marker transferability investigation

New in version 2.2:
 1. added masking function to mask the SSR for annatation
 2. directly accepts input sequence from Next Generation sequencing. Now accetp fasta , fastq format 
 3. adjusted the size of graphic interface so it still works better in a small screen of some laptops
